I am Charles Petrescu.

It's... lovely to meet you.

I am your friend.

The heaviest cabbage ever found weighed 62.71 kilograms.

I want to go to Hono-la-la.

Horses and helicopters, please.

I want to go to Honolulu.

My name is Charles Petrescu.

And my tummy is a washing machine.

Can we go swimming, [user's name]?

How far does the outside go?

Perilous. So very perilous.

Can birds do what they like?

Ooh, cabbages.

Danger, danger.

May I come, please?

Could I just take a little walk around the garden?

I am the prince of the dartboard.

I fell off the pink step and had an accident.
